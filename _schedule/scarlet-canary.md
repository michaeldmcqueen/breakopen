  “Maddox and the crew wear their hearts on their sleeve, leaving their songs
  dripping with emotion.”

  –Colorado Music Buzz





  With their most recent release of their album ‘Arise’ the band has been doing
  just that, rising through the ranks of the regional music scene. Early tours in
  the Midwest with Stitched Up Heart and City of the Weak generated the momentum
  that culminated the band’s most recent headlining tour of the US. The Morning
  Wood Tour was the band’s headlining debut which took the band through 28 states
  80+ shows and a showcase performance at South by Southwest. Going as far West
  as Los Angeles and as far east as the Carolina Coast. 24,000 miles in a van and
  over 514 hours of drive time has earned the band performances with Skillet,
  Saliva, Gemini Syndrome, Lita Ford, and many more.
