title: Ben Hanna
description: 'Hanna calls what he does “Post-Suburban Americana” and has likened it to a very contemporary blend of Americana-inspired storytelling and rebellious, high-energy “rawk”. Citing Lou Reed, Todd Snider, Bob Dylan, The Violent Femmes and Townes Van Zandt as some of his major musical influences, make no mistake; Ben Hanna Music is it’s own animal. Whether it’s through his writing or his performances; he’s sure to make you feel something. The thing about Hanna’s music is it doesn’t reflect the popularly pretentious lifestyle top 40 music often depicts. Instead, Hanna observes the less-than-glorious contemporary human experiences everyone experiences in modern society; social media, modern romance, jealousy, awkwardness, boredom and vice.'
