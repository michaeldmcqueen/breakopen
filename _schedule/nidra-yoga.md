title: Nidra Yoga
description: 'Yoga Nidra, or yogic sleep, is a practice in which you learn to put the body to sleep while maintaining full conscious awareness. In this way, one learns how to fully relax at will and navigate the subtle layers of the energy field, emotional body, and subconscious mind, and ultimately how to move beyond the mind to a point of deep restoration and stillness. From this space, one effortlessly restores health to all layers of their being, gains access their inner truth and wisdom, and can reprogram the way they think and interact with the world.'
