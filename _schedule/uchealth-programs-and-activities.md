Processing Trauma: finding your way through Grief, Loss, Depression, PTSD & CPTSD - Led by Liz Gaylor

Join Liz Gaylor, a local musician and certified clinical master herbalist (owner of Mountain Aven Herbal), in a discussion about ways to move through trauma, beyond "surviving" and into "thriving". Her personal journey through a generational family history of mental health challenges, childhood Complex-PTSD, the suicide of her grandfather, depression and grief and the suicide of her younger brother, gives her a unique perspective and toolbox to discuss the many issues these types of traumas may bring.
