"Be a Lifeline": Introduction to Mental Health First Aid is designed to give community members a feel for the entire curriculum of Mental Health First Aid and Youth Mental Health First Aid. &nbsp;These programs are evidence based curriculums designed to teach anyone how to help an individual who is experiencing a mental health or addictions challenge or is in crisis. &nbsp;Just as CPR helps someone assist an individual having a heart attack - even if they have no clinical training - Mental Health First Aid helps assist someone experiencing a mental health-related crisis. &nbsp;In this Introduction class, participants will learn about the basic principles around MHFA and how to potentially help as well as where they can sign up for the entire 8-hour class.
