In its first year the Mental Health Festival is a quest for self discovery and health and happiness in the Fort Collins community. The event is set to take place at The Downtown Artery and Lyric Cinema&nbsp;

By connecting with artists and bridging the community we celebrate art and achievements of people and offer support for the creatives in our community that struggle with mental health, exploring the relationship between creativity and the mind and promoting positive health and well being.

Workshops will be broken into morning and afternoon sessions with the conference featuring nutrition and wellness, suicide prevention, substance abuse help and other topics. Programming to be announced soon.&nbsp;
